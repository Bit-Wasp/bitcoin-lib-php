bitcoin-lib-php
===============

PHP libraries implementing bitcoin key functions, as well as BIP32 and electrum.

The library intends to expose a lot of general functionality which isn't 
available using the RPC (like deterministic addresses). 

It also allows you to reduce the number of queries that are made to bitcoind,
such as createrawtransaction/signrawtransaction/decoderawtransaction. As such,
such, use of bitcoin RPC functionality can be kept to a minimum.

Libraries
=========
- Raw Transactions: create, sign, validate, with support for P2SH. 
- Create multi-signature addresses, create redeeming transactions. 
- BIP32: Functions for generating BIP32 deterministic keys.
- Electrum: Create seed from mnemonic, create MPK from seed, derive public keys from MPK, or private keys from seed.
- BitcoinLib: The core class, with key functionality, encoding/decoding & validation functions, etc. 


If this library powers your project and you're feeling tipsy, buy me lunch some day! 1sCVtkEhQmvp3D4K22Pw9xhFPTDWFh8SZ
